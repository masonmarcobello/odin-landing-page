# odin-landing-page
landing page exercise from the odin project foundations course 

To keep in mind: 

The font that’s being used in the images is roboto.

Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.

I'll be sharing reflections after the project is finished.

I finished this project on 27/01/2023. 

To be honest, it took a lot of back-and-forth checking the code of some of the more popular solutions, which only confused me even more, given how some of them were structured and styled. I don't have much of an issue with HTML structure, but I'm going to have to review CSS and flexbox to understand the logic, rather than blinding copying/pasting answers or guides via chat GPT or w3 schools. But, overall, I'm happy I completed it after feeling quite stuck. Praise be to lord kek! 

I've also copied this landing page into a separate repo and will continue updating/working on it on my own time.

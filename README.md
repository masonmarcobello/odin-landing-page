# odin-landing-page
landing page exercise from the odin project foundations course 

To keep in mind: 

The font that’s being used in the images is roboto.

Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.

I'll be sharing reflections after the project is finished.
